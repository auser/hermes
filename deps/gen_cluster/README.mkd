gen_cluster
===========

Summary
=======
`gen_cluster` is an erlang behavior for *pid* clustering. It is a cascading behavior that builds on `gen_server`.

# Status

Early alpha. Feel free to use this in production code as long as you know that nobody else is.

# Motivation

Erlang provides many BIFs for dealing with nodes, node clustering, monitoring
etc. However, one often wants to build a cluster of _processes_ rather than
entire nodes. 

This module is a starting point for creating your own `gen_server` clusters. It
aims to deal with common roles, actions, and callbacks one often deals with
when making a cluster. 

As usual, there are a number of subtleties that crop up when trying to create a
cluster. The goal is for `gen_cluster` to allow one to gloss-over these details
and simply provide an easy-to-use foundation for cluster-based erlang
projects. 

# Features

Current features include:

* Joining a cluster based on a given `seed` node
* Storing the list of all current nodes in the cluster
* Callbacks when a node joins or leaves

# Usage

Add the `behaviour` directive to your module, implement the callbacks for both `gen_server` and `gen_cluster`. See `example_cluster_srv.erl` for full example and function signatures. 

    -behaviour(gen_cluster).

    % gen_server callbacks
    -export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).

    % gen_cluster callback
    -export([handle_join/3, handle_node_joined/3, handle_leave/4]).

# Try it out

Open up three terminals and do the following commands. This will start up three
nodes that will join the first node. On `q().` of any one of the nodes the
other two will see that the node left and update the pidlist accordingly.

    # term 1
    rake server:start1

    # term 2
    rake server:start2

    # term 3
    rake server:start3

    # term 2 again
    q().

# Plans

(features not yet implemented)

* Globally registered name needs to be taken over by another node if the globally registered node dies. This is an important TODO and will be handled shortly. 
* TCP-layer option, rather than straight distributed erlang
* Possible integration with [Chordjerl](http://github.com/jashmenn/chordjerl/tree)
